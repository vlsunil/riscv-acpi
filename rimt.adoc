*RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)*

[.text-center]
#*_DRAFT FOR REVIEW_*#

This is a proposal for an ACPI representation of the relationship between
IO devices and RISC-V IOMMU.

The RISC-V IOMMU specificaiton defines an IOMMU for RISC-V platforms
which can be a regular platform device or a PCIe device connected to
the host root port.

The RISC-V IOMMU provides two stage translation, device directory table,
command queue and fault reporting as wired interrupt or MSIx event for
both PCIe and platform devices.

The RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)  provides information about the RISC-V
IOMMU and the relationship between the IO topology and the IOMMU.

The ID mapping structure provides information on how devices are
connected to an IOMMU. The devices may be natively identified by a source ID but the platform
may used a remapped ID to identify transactions from the device to the IOMMU. Each ID mapping
array entry provides a mapping from a range of source IDs to the corresponding device IDs that
will be used at the input to the IOMMU.

|Destination Device ID Base | 4| 4| The base of the destination ID range as mapped by this entry.
|Number of IDs | 4| 8| Number of IDs in the range. The vaue in this field follows N-1 convension.

There may be non-PCIe platform devices which are enumerated using Differentiated System Description Table(DSDT).
These devices may have one or more source IDs in the mapping table. But they can have its own scheme
to define the source IDs. Hence, those source IDs can be unique within the ACPI device only.
