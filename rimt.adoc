*RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)*

[.text-center]
#*_DRAFT FOR REVIEW_*#

This is a proposal for an ACPI representation of the relationship between
IO devices and RISC-V IOMMU.

The RISC-V IOMMU specificaiton defines an IOMMU for RISC-V platforms
which can be a regular platform device or a PCIe device connected to
the host root port.

The RISC-V IOMMU provides two stage translation, device directory table,
command queue and fault reporting as wired interrupt or MSIx event for
both PCIe and platform devices.

The RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)  provides information about the RISC-V
IOMMU and the relationship between the IO topology and the IOMMU.

There can be non-PCIe platform devices which are enumerated using Differentiated System Description Table(DSDT).
These devices can have one or more source IDs in the mapping table. But they can have its own scheme
to define the source IDs. Hence, those source IDs can be unique within the ACPI device only.
